ðŸ“– Learning Goals

This project is designed for learners who want to:

Understand the basics of Hibernate configuration.

Explore how to map Java classes to database tables using JPA annotations (@Entity, @Id, @GeneratedValue, @Column).

Learn how to perform simple CRUD operations (insert and read).

Build confidence working with Hibernate queries.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements

The current implementation is intentionally simple, focusing only on book names. It can be extended with:

Adding authors, genres, and publication dates.

Updating and deleting book records.

Implementing a simple console menu or REST API for interaction.

Expanding into a complete Library Management System.
